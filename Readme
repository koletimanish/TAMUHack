We're working to make it easy to be prepared for the worst. We want to consolidate data pertinent to

cataclysmic events, especially wildfires which decimate everything in their path. Flames tore through 
thousands of homes in California, the ripped apart the lusciousAmazon rainforest, and slaughtered a billion animals in Australia.
